# Lesson 4 Exercises

Unless otherwise directed in the following problems, state what is printed. Some of these problems may have incorrect syntax and in those cases you should answer that the code would not compile.  

1. 

```java
int h = 103;  
int p =5;  
System.out.println(++h + p);  
System.out.println(h);  
```

2. Give three code examples of how to increment the integer `j` by `1`.  
3. 

```java
double def;  
double f = 1992.37;  
def = f;  
System.out.println(def); 
```

4. Write a single line of code that will print the integer variable `zulu` and then decrement its value by `1`.  
  
5. 

```java
int a = 100;  
int b = 200;  
b /= a;  
System.out.println(b + 1);  
```

6. Write a single line of code that uses the compound operator, `-=`, to subtract `p - 30` from the integer value `v` and store the result back in `v`.  
  
7. Write a single line of code that does the same thing as #6 but without using `-=`.  
  
8. 

```java
int p = 40;  
int q = 4;  
System.out.println(2 + 8 * q / 2 - p);  
```

9. 

```java
int sd = 12;  
int x = 4;  
System.out.println( sd%(++x) );  
System.out.println(x); 
```

10. 

```java
int g;  
3 = g;  
System.out.println(++g*79);  
```

What is the result?  

11. On a single line of code declare `m`, `b`, and `f` to be `double` and on that same line initialize them all to be `3.14`.  
12. On a single line of code declare `x`, `y`, and `z` all to be of integer type.  
13. 

```java
int m = 36;  
int j = 5;  
m = m / j; // new m is old m divided by j  
System.out.println(m);  
```

What’s printed? 

14. 

```java
System.out.println(3/4 + 5*2/33 –3 +8*3);  
```

What’s printed? 
 
15. What is the assignment operator?  
16. Write a statement that stores the remainder of dividing the variable `i` by `j` in a variable named `k`.  
17. 

```java
int j = 2; 
System.out.println(7%3 + j++ + (j – 2) ); 
```

18. Show three different ways to decrement the variable `j`.
